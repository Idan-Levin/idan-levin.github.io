This allows for the integration of standalone web applications into a more socially interactive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;import-enrich-export&quot;&gt;Import, Enrich, Export&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key advantages of Farcaster is its open API, which stands in contrast to other social platforms that often try to lock users in. With Farcaster, you can always export data with an open API. The ‘server-side’ in Farcaster is a P2P network composed of hubs, and you can always find a hub that will provide the data, or run one yourself. This is the export side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the recent introduction of frames also allows for another interesting model, which is open import. You can take an existing web app, transition it into a Frame app, and publish it as a cast (today it is technically limited to the OpenGraph standard, but soon expected to be upgraded to iFrames which are more versatile).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you convert web apps into frames, something magical happens – you can enrich them with social data—such as likes, shares, and comments. A piece of the app can be added contextual social data when embedding them in Farcaster. Because the ‘export’ module is always on (no one can shut down the API), this makes for a powerful primitive that allows us to import, enrich, and export back the web app. This process takes a piece of static app with no social context and exapnds it with social knowledge and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-potential-of-open-importexport&quot;&gt;The Potential of Open Import/Export&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The openness of Farcaster’s import/export functionality holds a really big potential. By enabling the enrichment of every application with social layers, Farcaster can make every app a social app. If you can convert it to a frame, you can enrich it. And export it back. This makes everything social.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/import.png&quot; alt=&quot;theme logo&quot; class=&quot;ioda&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-feedback-loop-between-import-and-export&quot;&gt;The Feedback Loop Between Import and Export&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farcaster’s feedback loop mechanism can play a big role in expanding the social graph. The enriched data and user interactions feed back into the main UI, which creates new social experiences and more motivation to import apps as frames and strengthens the Farcaster social graph. As more applications are enriched and more interactions occur, the Farcaster social graph becomes more robust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this import, enrich, export model will be relevant to financial apps, or if it can be extended to many more use cases that are not financial in nature. For example, sharing an album as a frame, enriching it with social data, and exporting it back to the app. Eventually, this process could also work backwards, with the web app providing write capabilities that will feed the Farcaster social graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are very early in exploring this primitive, and I’m excited to see where will it land in a few years from now!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Idan Levin</name></author><category term="blog_posts" /><summary type="html">Farcaster offers a new way to enrich crypto financial experiences, whether it’s buying physical items, digital items like NFTs, sports betting, or engaging in prediction markets.

&lt;p&gt;Explaining from first principles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blockchains are computers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Computer history has shown us that when you build more bandwidth, storage, and compute capacity, developers build more demanding apps and use these excess resources.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That is why, no matter how many transactions/gas you can process per second, if you’re a successful blockchain, it will never be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This will result in one of two scenarios: fees go up, or you need to increase hardware/networking requirements for nodes (which leads to centralization).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can’t solve this with gadgets like differential pricing for high-demand pieces of state. You just isolate the problem from interfering with other things (high-demand apps will still be expensive). It’s still an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All roads lead to execution sharding. Call it whatever you want (shards/rollups/subchains).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you go to sharding the execution and decoupling execution and consensus, what do you need for a base settlement layer?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But even before that, what don’t you (really) need? - parallel execution, fancy networking gadgets, or some crazy VM.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you actually need? Heavy economic security, verifiability of every piece of the stack, heavy research on potential black swans and security risks, support for validation of shards/rollups state transitions, support for escape hatches to prevent censorship in rollups, and a code language that is battle-tested and free of bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These things have massive network effects, and I don’t think any other chain other than Ethereum is close to achieving these things. Does this make me a maxi? No. I thought about these things from the ground up, and if any other chain aims toward these futures, I’ll be there to support it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;And lastly, where can I be wrong and where do other smart people disagree with me?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the nature of the disagreement lies in the core assumption of what a blockchain is. If you see it as a Nasdaq substitute or some purely financial system, then your mental model is: if I can get a blockchain to x TPS, I’m done. This point of view assumes there is a saturation point for demand, like Visa or Google queries, and once you reach it, demand will reach an equilibrium. I think this perspective comes from too much skeuomorphism around thinking of blockchains in the context of finance. But anyway, this is the core disagreement between monolithic and modular blockchains. If blockchains are computers, I think that monolithic blockchains will lose the battle of scaling. If blockchains are Visa substitutes, monolithic blockchains will win over the complex and fragmented modular blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case, long live blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Idan Levin</name></author><category term="blog_posts" /><summary type="html">Why I don’t believe in monolithic blockchains?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">come for the memecoin, stay for the network</title><link href="https://idan-levin.github.io/idanlevin.github.io//come-for-the-memecoin-stay-for-the-network.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="come for the memecoin, stay for the network" /><published>2024-05-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://idan-levin.github.io/idanlevin.github.io//%20come%20for%20the%20memecoin,%20stay%20for%20the%20network</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://idan-levin.github.io/idanlevin.github.io//come-for-the-memecoin-stay-for-the-network.html">&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of business ‘entry points’ that Chris Dixon’s famous blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cdixon.org/2015/01/31/come-for-the-tool-stay-for-the-network&quot;&gt;‘come for the tool, stay for the network’&lt;/a&gt;, describes. The playbook of attracting users to some tool which gives them immediate benefit, and then building a network based on this attraction, always felt brilliant to me. Instagram is a famous example in which it started as a filter tool (single-player mode) and then extended into a social network (multiplayer mode).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this playbook happens in quite a similar way around crypto memecoins or generally speculation. Users that speculate on memecoins need to jump through some fiery hoops to get to the point where they can purchase the memecoins - they need to download a wallet, onramp (most new memecoins are not listed immediately on centralized exchanges), and learn to interact with the respective blockchain. A lot of time this also requires some degree of technical savviness, because these new memecoins are only available in new applications that live on the crypto frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this initial bootstrapping phase (‘come for the memecoin’), there is a group of users that went through the learning curve of using the chain and its tooling, plus some initial liquidity they seeded. Because capital that flowed into the chain doesn’t easily flow out, there is now some ‘potential energy’ in the chain in the form of educated users and some initial locked capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Builders looking to build some new blockchain apps now have a distribution of users they can interact with. Getting users that already onboarded the chain is much easier than persuading them to jump through the fiery hoops of the learning curve from scratch. So although memecoin speculation is a casino game, it does seed some potential in the respective chain. That is why for new blockchains without any substantial usage, becoming a short-term casino has some obvious benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Idan Levin</name></author><category term="blog_posts" /><summary type="html">I love the idea of business ‘entry points’ that Chris Dixon’s famous blog post, ‘come for the tool, stay for the network’, describes.

He analyzed how social media platforms act as status-generating services, where users perform activities to gain social capital, similar to a video game where status is the score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He theorized that social platforms operate by offering users status in exchange for engaging content, which in turn helps these platforms grow. His description encapsulates really well the essence of the social media game and provides a great mental model to think about the future of social networks and status-creation over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;algorithm-as-a-status-controller&quot;&gt;Algorithm as a Status Controller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can view status as the currency of these social networks. On platforms like Twitter, likes, retweets, and follows are considered the ingredients of social status. Users create engaging tweets about news, culture, or entertainment and populate the town square of Twitter. In return, they gain followers which is akin to status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforms control the distribution of status by managing the feed algorithm. They determine what content is seen and by whom. By designing these algorithms, platforms can influence which actions are rewarded with visibility. In response, users adjust their strategies to the algorithm to gain more status. The algorithm is the ‘invisible hand’ that exists in social media, dictating the fate of how social status is created or destroyed. Shadow banning, the practice of hiding a user’s visibility from other users’ feeds, is the secret weapon of social networks, allowing the platform to completely erase a user’s social status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/degen1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Degen Image 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;social-status-in-web3&quot;&gt;Social Status in Web3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web3 social networks innovate on the idea of status generation and control. Farcaster would probably be the best place to analyze and estimate today how web3 social networks will impact the distribution of online — or onchain — status in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farcaster is a relatively new, decentralized web3 social network that has shown solid growth in 2024. It grew from 2,000 active users at the beginning of the year to over 80,000 DAUs as of today, thanks to the introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/what-is-farcaster/frames&quot;&gt;Frames&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.farcaster.xyz/learn/what-is-farcaster/channels&quot;&gt;channels&lt;/a&gt;, which were highly successful features that enabled developers to build ‘mini-apps’ on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social graph and social activity in Farcaster are recorded on the protocol, a peer-to-peer network which holds the replicated state of the network. However, users usually interact with the protocol through the Warpcast client, which looks and feels much like the Twitter app but with additional features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team that created the Farcaster protocol also maintains Warpcast, where most of the activity occurs. &lt;strong&gt;This means that the population of the social graph on Farcaster, the protocol, happens mostly with the intent of the Warpcast client, which controls the algorithm.&lt;/strong&gt; This is similar to web2, where the team controlling the client also controls the algorithm and status creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-curious-case-of-degen&quot;&gt;The Curious Case of Degen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Degen began as a community coin for the Degen channel on Warpcast in January 2024. The community held a contest to choose a logo and branding, and the purple top hat was selected 🎩. The Degen token grew organically within Warpcast, with its first utility being a tipping system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system was straightforward—users could reply to casts with ‘X $Degen’ to indicate the tip they wanted to give. The offchain tipping system scanned Farcaster, summed up all the Degen tips, and airdropped them into the respective user’s wallet (this type of experiment was also made in 2020 with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki/&quot;&gt;$MOON coin&lt;/a&gt; on r/CryptoCurrency under a community points product rolled out by Reddit. This product was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/17a33ql/serious_sunsetting_community_points_beta_and/&quot;&gt;sunset&lt;/a&gt; on Oct-23).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was only possible because of the open nature of Farcaster; the network is always readable, and unlike other social networks that tightly control their APIs, an external system can always read the state of the network. This was also facilitated by every address in Farcaster being linked to a wallet address, making it easy to airdrop tokens to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early Degen team made two brilliant decisions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Users could tip without any wallet transaction, just by replying in casts (very low friction).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Degen distributions were created out of thin air; every day users received an allowance, so it didn’t feel like spending something, but rather like contributing to someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two brilliant decisions created something entirely new, which is the subject I want to get to—a new social status distribution system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;degen-as-a-status-distribution-mechanism&quot;&gt;Degen as a Status Distribution Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One side effect of the Degen tipping system was that it created an alternate universe to distribute status on the Warpcast client, independent of the Warpcast feed algorithm. Tipping was permissionless, and suddenly there was another status creation game outside the control of Warpcast. Users that seek to play in the status generation game could now play two types of games - the traditional game, which is getting likes and follows on Warpcast, and the Degen game, which was writing content that the Degen community would reward with tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status creation is so significant that after a user receives the Degen token (an ERC20), they completely control it and can port its status anywhere outside of the Farcaster ecosystem. Meaning, Degen social status is portable, unlike legacy status created in the web2 systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This created an external system that rewards users with social status for good content, which is outside the control of the core social media algorithm.&lt;/strong&gt; This is only technically feasible because Farcaster is open, which explains why we don’t really see these activities outside of web3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/degen2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Degen Image 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A unique Degen Actions button was added to see how much Degen an address holds (‘Bag Bias’) and what its allowance status is (‘$DEGEN stats). This allows to add social status to each account not only in traditional terms, but also with the new layer of Degen social status. You can now know the Degen social status of each account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if I had to describe Degen from this standpoint, I would probably say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Degen is an autonomous social status network, governed by the Degen community, that creates portable social network status.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/degen3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Degen Image 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I sent this post for review, I got some feedback that there is another angle to the Degen tipping game which is - Degen is more about paying for good content and less about social status. But because of the close relationship between writing good content and earning social status in the platform (in the form of followers, shares, and likes), I think it makes sense to think of Degen distribution as both a form of money and status, and you can almost use both of these interchangeably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buying-vs-earning&quot;&gt;Buying vs. earning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is one caveat to Degen status creation: you can buy Degen. Since the token is completely tradable, you can’t really view Degen holdings as pure status because some might have been acquired organically and some might have been bought on the markets. It has yet to be known and explored how the tradability of Degen will impact its status formation, but there is a wide design space to explore which includes different tipping systems and their status creation capabilities (I list a few in the next section, such as soul bound tipping).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exploring-new-ideas&quot;&gt;Exploring New Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can play with the mechanism behind Degen to create a wide design space of external status creation systems. Here are some rough ideas that might be explored:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other content-enhancing coins –&lt;/strong&gt; Can we create an AI coin that gets tipped for excellent AI technical content? Or content about food for the foodies? How granular can we take the idea of content enhancement? Will we have tiny micro status communities in the future for every niche vertical?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farcaster clients based on the Degen reputation system&lt;/strong&gt; – create another client that prioritizes Degen holdings when deciding which content to show in the feed. This will be a Degen-first client, where the Degen community can have full control over curation. Should bought Degen receive the same weight as earned Degen?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soul bound tipping (non-transferable tipping)&lt;/strong&gt; – tip with coins in a non-transferable way, which could create a long-term social status for the address but also is less speculative and harder to bootstrap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that Degen, although it started as a fun experiment, is a pioneering project in the creation and distribution of social status over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the lightweight tipping system it created, it promotes independence from monolithic platforms and enhances user freedom. Once Farcaster has enabled open state to be read, it created room for creating new types of social status systems on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more experimentation that should take place in the future around external status creation, and this is just the beginning. If you’re working on something like this, make sure you ping me :)&lt;/p&gt;

You need to live in the future, being able to see what’s going to happen. But you also need to live in the current state, and see what is missing today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You always have to live in these two states, which is extremely hard. If you get stuck in one specific state too much, you’re in a problem – if you live too much in the future, you become not practical. You lose focus with the execution plan, and basically just float around in imagination. If you live too much in today, you don’t have a north star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few tricks that you can pull on your mind to balance yourself out between these two states. The trick to be in today’s state is being very active and participating in related activities. If you want to build an onchain commerce protocol on the blockchain, you need to use any commerce platform you can put your hands on. You need to experience this in a highly attentive mode, really sucking in every bit of the onchain commerce experience. You see what are the pain points, and you experience them with your hands. That will keep you grounded to what is real. That will keep you grounded on how many problems exist. That will show you how hard it is to build something meaningful. You will have to ask meaningful questions, like what is the go-to-market strategy? what are the pain points? how do I solve something meaningful tomorrow morning?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in the future is different. It is less obvious how to trick yourself into it, and there are fewer out-of-the-box solutions to inspire yourself to see the future. I like to read books and take walks, and when I do these two things enough, I feel myself transcending to the future quantum state. The kind of books I read are about technology or science fiction. I like books by deep thinkers. So in the case of building something onchain, “Read Write Own” by Chris Dixon is an example of a book that can inspire you (although it doesn’t have to necessarily be on the subject you are building in). These books will help you see the big picture and connect it to your story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like to take long walks or jog. These activities stimulate my brain, and combined with reading deeply, it balances living in the current state and help me transcend to the future state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in summary, you will need to balance yourself in the quantum state of today and the future. Being in today’s state is being active. Being in the future is getting inspiration and letting your mind wander.

This concept underpins the open-source movement, which advocates for open access to source code and collaborative development as a path to more reliable and higher-quality software, in contrast to traditional closed-source methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the blockchain world, a related concept involves the cost of running a full node. A full node typically means downloading the historical state, verifying it up to the current chain tip, and participating in real-time block reception and validation (not necessarily proposing blocks for network consensus). The cost of running a full node varies across different crypto networks, ranging from a few hundred dollars to millions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expense isn’t just about hardware and maintenance; it’s also about the complexity of the node software. I believe that the cost of running a full node is generally indicative of a network’s openness or, more specifically, the applicability of Linus’s rule. Low-cost nodes, which are more numerous and accessible, invite diverse participation. In contrast, networks with prohibitively expensive nodes often see participation limited to businesses, while affordable nodes attract hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hobbyists are crucial. They tend to be more neutral and openly critical. When the cost to run a node is low, a network is more likely to face scrutiny and attract a broader range of observers. Conversely, in networks where node operation is costly, only businesses with different incentives and motivations tend to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This situation has two primary effects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bugs in network architecture take longer to be discovered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The network may accumulate unaddressed risks over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter point relates to a lack of incentive for whistleblowing; the former, to the simple law of large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, I’m more cautious about networks with high participation costs. They require more time to prove their robustness, and they carry a higher risk of accumulating systemic issues. While high-cost networks can still function, when it comes to the robustness stemming from open-source development, I tend to trust architectures derived from networks with lower participation costs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Idan Levin</name></author><category term="blog_posts" /><summary type="html">Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, famously said, “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” This quote highlights a key principle of open-source software: the more people who scrutinize a piece of code, the quicker and more effectively bugs and issues are identified and resolved.

The game typically involves participants sitting in a circle or a line. The first person thinks of a message and whispers it to the next person, who then passes it on. As the message travels, it often becomes garbled and significantly changes from the original. The final version, announced by the last person, is usually very different from the initial one, and in some cases unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game illustrates “information entropy,” a concept from mathematics and information theory coined by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.” Information entropy measures the unpredictability in a set of outcomes. In Broken Telephone, each whisper introduces potential errors, increasing the entropy and distorting the original message. This process is akin to a compounding error rate, where noise increases with each transfer, eventually resulting in significant information loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does information entropy have to do with blockchains? Blockchains deal with trust (or, trustlessness), and if you’ll think about it hard enough, you will recognize a close relationship between how information and trust behave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-and-society&quot;&gt;Trust and society&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is fundamental in society. It’s the confidence in the reliability and integrity of a person or system. We trust our cars, elevators, airplane manufacturers, and food producers. We trust societal rules to protect us from crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is essential, but it’s also complex. Trusting someone or a system is a consequence of complex processes each of us is doing when underwriting our trust in another person or system. Humans also frequently use a ‘delegation algorithm’ – if others trust something, we’re more likely to trust it too. The majority of things we trust in our day-to-day is a consequence of trust delegation, we actually verify very little things by ourselves in modern society (if you would try to, you probably won’t have too much spare time to do anything rather verifying all day long).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is everywhere, and society can’t function without it. A mental model that I like for trust, can be thought of as a &lt;strong&gt;chain of components, each its own piece of trust&lt;/strong&gt;. In airplane manufacturing for example, this chain extends across various parties - manufacturers trust vendors to meet quality and safety standards. Airlines trust engineers and designers. Regulatory bodies develop safety standards, and passengers trust these authorities for aircraft safety. Trust also extends to airline staff, from pilots to maintenance crews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/entropy1.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ioda&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-and-information&quot;&gt;Trust and information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been playing with the idea that &lt;strong&gt;trust is a derivative of information, sharing similar properties&lt;/strong&gt; for quite some time now. In a trust chain, each node ‘passes’ trust to the next one. However, like in Chinese Whispers, there’s trust erosion with each transfer. A ‘loss factor’ or ‘error rate’ accumulates in the network. Because of that, longer trust chains based on pure human interaction get’s weaker with size. This is an intuitive conclusion if you think of your daily life - It’s easier to verify close interactions than distant ones.
For instance, consider the trust you place in a local restaurant versus a distant food manufacturer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trusting-a-local-restaurant&quot;&gt;Trusting a local restaurant:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: You’ve eaten at this restaurant many times and consistently found the food to be delicious and high-quality. You might have met the owners and know who they are.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Observation&lt;/strong&gt;: You’ve witnessed the restaurant’s cleanliness and the staff’s meticulous care in food preparation and service.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immediate Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;: The restaurant addresses any concerns or special requests right away, enhancing your trust in their service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, your trust in the restaurant is based on direct, repeated, and personal experiences. It’s straightforward to verify because your interactions with the restaurant and its staff are regular and direct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trusting-a-distant-food-manufacturer&quot;&gt;Trusting a distant food manufacturer:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Personal Experience&lt;/strong&gt;: You’ve never visited the manufacturing facility, so you have no firsthand experience with the manufacturer’s processes. You have no clue who are the shareholders of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Direct Observation&lt;/strong&gt;: You’re unable to see the product’s creation, the working conditions, or the quality control measures firsthand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed or Limited Feedback&lt;/strong&gt;: Any issues you have with the product can only be addressed through customer service, which might be slow to respond or just not veru personal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, verifying the food manufacturer is much more challenging. You might rely on reviews, brand reputation, or certifications, but these are indirect ways of establishing trust. The physical and experiential distance introduces more variables and uncertainties, complicating the establishment of trust compared to the local restaurant scenario. I call this concept Trust Entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/entropy2.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ioda&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trust-entropy-increases-with-the-size-of-collaborating-humans&quot;&gt;Trust Entropy increases with the size of collaborating humans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuval Noah Harari, in his book “Sapiens,” explains how humans scaled from small groups to nation-states using mechanisms like mass communication and shared culture. We’ve gotten a long way from painting stories on the cave wall – we can use mass communications like radio, TV, and the internet, to spread ideas and information across the world in the speed of light.
However, it seems like modern society faces a ‘trust barrier.’ With more information comes more fake news, more conspiracies, and more information warfare. It seems like at some point, trust is eroding.  It is no coincidence that public trust in governments is reaching historical lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/entropy3.png&quot; alt=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ioda&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond a certain point, trust doesn’t scale with current technology&lt;/strong&gt;. The internet has brought us information efficiency, but it cannot scale trust by itself. Human collaboration is hindered by significant entropy in the trust chain, evident in societal distrust, from vaccine scepticism to conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-trust-verify&quot;&gt;‘Don’t trust, verify’&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Don’t trust, verify’ is a phrase often heard in blockchain contexts. Public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to verify the network state (e.g., Bitcoin holdings) independently by running their own nodes, reducing reliance on third parties, and shortening the trust chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, using Bitcoin still involves trust in hardware manufacturers and internet providers, among other things. Blockchain technology requires less trust than traditional systems and shortens the trust chain (but doesn’t eliminate it entirely, which is a common mistake maximalist do). Open-source smart contracts on Ethereum let users verify contracts logic directly. These contracts can replace many trust-dependent societal functions, allowing for shorter trust chains in international settlements, and collaboration across the internet with very low trust barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-blockchains&quot;&gt;Why Blockchains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blockchains provide a verifiable database and logic, creating coordination systems that require far less trust than current mechanisms (I really like Chris Dixon definition: “blockchains are computers that can make commitments”. This is another way of describing trust machines, because commitments = trust enabler). The internet scaled information transfer globally, but the trust component is still lacking. Blockchains matter because they fill this gap. Enhancing trust chains with math and cryptography avoids the errors of human trust transmission, as seen in Chinese Whispers. 
The idea is that humans don’t have to build these long trust chains, that gets eroded through time. You can use blockchains to reduce the length of these chains or make them more robust. More verifiability means more trust, and more trust means more collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I believe the blockchain is one of the greatest inventions of this century – it will enable us to collaborate on a whole new scale. The fight against trust entropy is here. We need blockchains to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crypto enthusiasts love the idea of prediction markets and the information efficiency they can bring to the world when done on an internet scale (&lt;a href=&quot;https://decrypt.co/47178/vitalik-buterin-crypto-prediction-markets-outperformed-forecasts&quot;&gt;Vitalik’s take’&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, they seem to overlook that, at the moment, prediction markets are - (drum roll)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can label it differently (UX, etc.), but the truth is they’re just not as much fun right now. or perhaps it’s better said - they’re much less fun compared to other crypto activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;betting on hamster races on telegram - really fun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;swapping meme coins on uniswap - really fun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flipping jpegs on blur - really fun&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;betting on who will be the next president of Argentina - much less fun. maybe around 10%-15% fun level of the above activities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of contribution to the efficiency of society:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;betting on hamster races on telegram - zero contribution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;swapping meme coins on uniswap - zero contribution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flipping jpegs on blur - zero contribution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;betting on the next president of Argentina - significant contribution to information efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to bring the fun level of prediction markets closer to other activities. then, we’ll reach the ‘changing the world’ zone - lots of fun and significant contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

It is quite common to watch tribes of developers and investors in crypto land fighting over what is the best/right tech, and ‘modular vs. monolithic’ is the current hot discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it is worthwhile explaining what modular and monolithic are, and why it matters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern blockchains store shared state and execute code, and the big question is how to do this efficiently - meaning how can you scale the execution of code and storage of shared state, without incurring big costs that are not affordable by users (and under the obvious constraints of public blockchains like decentralization, safety and liveness).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethereum has become really expensive over the last few years (in rush time transferring ETH might cost as high as a few tens of dollars), and competing blockchains like Solana are offering fast and cheap transfers that cost a few cents. To solve that, Ethereum aimed for a modular roadmap that will ease costs and increase throughput with low costs as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modular blockchains remind me of the same trend that we’ve seen with cloud computing - the cloud allowed computers to decompose into their different components. Over the cloud, you can consume compute, memory, and storage separately - each priced separately, and can be scaled horizontally or vertically independently. This allows for catering to varying needs, costs, and technical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same trend is happening with blockchains like Ethereum today. You can think of Ethereum as composed of different ‘layers’ - consensus/settlement, data availability, and execution. Consensus is the part that makes the network agree on a specific state, data availability provides the needed historical data to verify the network’s integrity, and execution is a runtime environment for executing codes (i.e., smart contracts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until 2020, usually, all these components lived together, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698&quot;&gt;but as of the end of 2020, Ethereum has adopted a ‘rollups-centric roadmap’&lt;/a&gt;, which is about turning itself into a settlement layer, while outsourcing execution and data availability to different layers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, there has been a Cambrian explosion of innovation across the different layers, such as rollups, which have raised billions of dollars in aggregate from the best investors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not everyone agrees on this approach. Blockchains like Solana approached the scalability and technical difficulties of blockchains with another approach - more engineering! Solana has innovated on many of the different components of a blockchain, around networking (faster P2P data propagation), consensus (parallel agreeing on a shared state using sophisticated consensus algorithms), and execution (parallel execution of code). You can find many new engineering gadgets in Solana that try to solve the scalability and cost tradeoffs better. But all of these components are cramped together in the same client (the software that nodes run), hence a monolith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The objectors to the monolithic Solana approach claim that this comes with a huge cost for running nodes on the network and contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchains, making the network less stable and more centralized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m in the modular camp. why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;modular--monolithic&quot;&gt;Modular &amp;gt; monolithic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open-source culture&lt;/strong&gt; - This allows for constant innovation across the stack and helps avoid protocol ossification. Anyone can add any teak to the EVM when it is an L2, or even use another VM (Eclipse is building a Solana based VM on Ethereum). Ethereum recently launched an RIP (Rollup Improvement Proposal) for the coordination of different imporvements between rollups and Ethereum.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-fragility&lt;/strong&gt; - The failure of a single component doesn’t bring everything down with it. So if tomorrow morning one of the rollup bridges gets hacked (i.e. a failure of an execution enviorment), the industry gets to survive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better pricing of network resources&lt;/strong&gt; - Modular pricing for compute, data availability, and settlement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better competition&lt;/strong&gt; (“tech discovery”) - Competition among different components helps the market discover the best technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allows for more nuanced usage/edge cases&lt;/strong&gt; - Different users have varying specifications; modular design caters to all of them. There are many cases of specialized VMs such as Canto, that are experimenting with new types of incentives and value accrual from different VM pricing models.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialization&lt;/strong&gt; - Each component in the stack can focus on what it does best. For example parallel execution, which Ethereum doesn’t need to prioritize, can be optimized at the rollup level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralization/scalability spectrum choice&lt;/strong&gt; - Allows users to choose their preferred position on this spectrum. Ethereum the monolith is expensive and decentralized, volition is more centralized with data but cheaper, validium is a middleground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monolithic architecture has some very obvious advantages - everything is composable and much easier to coordinate changes. However, I believe that open source collaboration will eventually compound to an extent that is unbeatable by other chains. The best historical example of this is Linux, with a great description of the open source model in the book ‘The Cathedral and the Bazaar’. Or, as they say - if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Idan Levin</name></author><category term="blog_posts" /><summary type="html">The 2023 price rally in Solana has ignited a fiery ‘geeky’ discussion on X between developer communities regarding different blockchain architectures.

These cards were a new product offering a $500 line of credit (~$5k in today’s terms). This move was a pioneering effort in the credit card industry and marked a significant shift in consumer finance. This event is known as the “Fresno Drop”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this event, credit was primarily offered by local businesses, like corner bars or stores, which allowed patrons to maintain open tabs recorded in ledger books. For larger purchases, consumers had to obtain individual loans. The Fresno Drop was a major step in expanding the availability and use of credit cards. Within 10 months, over a million BankAmericards had been distributed across California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dropping the new credit cards on many new customers, mostly not familiar with the concept of credit, BoA experienced massive fraud for a few years. But it later became a very successful business (and today one of the best businesses on earth as Visa). But note that in 1958, Bank of America was already one of the largest and most influential banks in the United States. The ability to educate the market in using a credit card, and standing the losses and massive fraud was the consequence of its stability and of being a well-established business. Could a credit-card startup educate the market in 1958 and take control of the market like they did? Probably not. Startups usually have 2-3 years between financing rounds, and they need to show results quickly. Withstanding years of fraud could be the valley of death for startups. Which means that not every market adoption product or behavior should come from startups, sometimes incumbents are actually the ones doing the heavy lifting of opening the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the crypto industry, I think for the first time we have trusted ‘institutions’ that can do this heavy lifting for us. One example is Coinbase, which lately issued a new product of attesting to their customers onchain (sort of a verification service). In less than 2 months, they have gotten to ~50k verified account attestations. Now for the first time, we have bridged massive amounts of people’s identity from offchain to onchain. This is not something very monetizable at the moment, so hard to see startups pulling this off. But as a public good / education mechanism, it is extremely effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that many of the things we want to see happen in crypto (e.g., onchain payments, voting) will actually be bootstrapped by institutions who have enough firepower to educate the market and withstand it financially. Sometimes the startup opportunity is actually piggybacking these efforts, and riding the incumbent education.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Idan Levin</name></author><category term="blog_posts" /><summary type="html">In 1958, Bank of America conducted an experimental financial campaign in Fresno, California, where they mailed out 60,000 credit cards to residents.
