  <h1>The role of art</h1>

  <h3 id="the-role-of-art">the role of art</h3>

<p>I always loved art and felt that I understand it on a deep level. I find art in the digital space extremly promising, but I also find a lot of people that don’t really understand art and its role in society.</p>

<p>Obviously ask a few different people ‘what is art’ and you’ll get a few different answers, but I do want to try and give you my persepective of what is art.</p>

<p>The short answer is that art is a sandbox for mind experimentation.For the long version I’ll give you an exmple:</p>

<p>Lets say you’re talking with a few strangers and you say something like ‘I believe the sun is green’. What will they think?  probably that you are either not smart, color blind, trying to get attention by saying something everyone knows is wrong, or something in that area. Everyone knows that the sun is not green, rather yellow, orange, or whitish. But certainly not green.</p>

<p>But lets say you paint a picture with a green sun, and you say this is your form of art. Maybe its abstract, but that’s “ok” by the “rules”. So</p>
