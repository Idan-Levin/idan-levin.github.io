  <h1>The role of art</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Art is the sneaky backdoor that let you slip in ideas into society subconscious”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find art in the crypto space to be a storng pillar in moving the industry forward. but I also find a lot of people that don’t really understand art.</p>

<p>I beleive art in in general has a really important role in the advancement of society (I know some of you are probably scratching their head right now, and maybe not connceting art and technology or societal advancements). Most people just don’t really pay too much atention to it. So I want to explain what is art <strong>to me</strong> and why I believe it so important.</p>

<p>Ask a few different people ‘what is art’ and you’ll get a few different answers. This is great, and actually after diving into my argument of why art is imortant you will see that this is exactly the purpose of art!</p>

<h4 id="what-is-art">what is art?</h4>

<p>The short answer is that art is a sandbox for mind experimentation, providing a “safe zone” for expressing controversial or non-conventional ideas. To explain deeper I’ll first start with an exmple:</p>

<p>Lets say you’re talking with a few people you just met and you say something like ‘I believe the sun is green’. What will they think? How will they respond to this saying? They will probably think that you are either not too smart, color blind, trying to get attention by saying something everyone knows is wrong, or something in that area. That is because everyone knows that the sun is not green, rather yellow, orange, or whitish. But certainly not green. We have a pretty deep consensus in society about what the color of the sun is, and what it is not. The consensus is based probably of the overlap of sunjective similar experience we are having when looking at the sun and interpreting its color in a certain way.</p>

<p>But lets say you meet a some new people and show them a painting you’ve made, with green sun. “This is my latest masterpiece!” you say.
Maybe its abstract art, maybe its not the best art, maybe not everyone will find your art beautiful. But that’s ok by the “rules”. The “rules” are that art can be subjective, and it doesn’t have to describe reality in an accurate way. Quite the contrary, we teach childern to be expressive and experiment with their imagination and art, and try to do creative things with art to expand their mind.</p>

<p>So people might not like the artwork itself, but they probably won’t tell you that you are not smart because you painted a green sun.</p>

<p>The bottom line with this short story, is that art creates a safe zone for mind experminets. In art, you can bend reality. You can say anything, even very controversial things.</p>

<h4 id="so-how-does-this-help-society-to-advance">So how does this help society to advance?</h4>

<p>They say that science advances one funeral at a time. The issue is, that people are wired to have consensus. When someone challages consensus, the usual societal response is to object. We know a few high profile example of this from human history:</p>

<p>Galileo Galilei, the 17th-century Italian astronomer, faced significant persecution not for asserting that the Earth was round, but for endorsing the heliocentric model, which posits that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun. This contradicted the then-dominant geocentric model, which claimed that the Earth was the center of the universe, a belief upheld by the Catholic Church. As a result of his assertions, Galileo was tried by the Roman Inquisition in 1633, found “vehemently suspect of heresy,” and spent the rest of his life under house arrest. This historical episode underscores the challenges faced by pioneers of scientific thought, even when their ideas are eventually proven correct.</p>

<p>Galileo went against the consensus, was right, but was damned to spend his life in misery for that.</p>

<p>Lets go throguh another example.</p>

<p>Albert Einstein, a pioneering physicist of the 20th century, faced considerable criticism and prejudice for his groundbreaking theory of relativity. After he published his theory, it was disparagingly referred to as “Jewish Science” by some detractors, particularly during the rise of Nazi Germany. This was a period marked by anti-Semitic sentiment, and Einstein’s revolutionary ideas were targeted due to his Jewish heritage. Despite the resistance and bigotry, Einstein’s theory of relativity has since been validated and forms the basis of modern physics. This instance mirrors the trials faced by many revolutionary thinkers, who, despite going against prevailing consensus and enduring condemnation, are later proven correct, thereby advancing our understanding of the world.</p>

<p>What do we learn from this? that humans are speced to resist change, and to support consensus. When consensus changes, even the smartest people in the room might get upset and reject it.</p>

<p>That’s where are comes in. Art lets you slip ideas that are non consensus throughout the ‘back door’. Because are is a safe zone, and you can say whatever you want because its “just art”, it allows you to slip in and test ideas that are non consensus in a safe way (and without getting mocked by socielty, or trailed if you’re Galileo).</p>

<p>Some historical example:</p>

<p>Pablo Picasso’s “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon”: This painting is considered a groundbreaking work of art because it broke away from traditional European painting in its depiction of distorted and deconstructed bodies, which can be seen as a representation of Picasso’s “mind experimentation.”</p>

<p>Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain”: Duchamp’s work, a urinal signed “R. Mutt,” challenged conventional notions of what constitutes art, forcing society to reconsider its definition.</p>

<p>Banksy’s Street Art: Banksy’s graffiti and installations often contain biting social commentary and challenge societal norms and authorities. His work is a contemporary example of art being used to question consensus and promote societal advancement.</p>

<p>Yoko Ono’s “Cut Piece”: This performance art piece saw Ono inviting audience members to cut off her clothing with a pair of scissors, challenging societal norms around gender, power, and violence.</p>

<p>This ideas do not skip crypto. Crypto art lets you</p>
