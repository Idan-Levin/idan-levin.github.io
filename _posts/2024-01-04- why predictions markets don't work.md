The discussion on Crypto Twitter about why prediction markets don't work really captures the essence of the expectations gap between crypto core enthusiasts/leaders and the users ("the people").

Crypto enthusiasts love the idea of prediction markets and the information efficiency they can bring to the world when done on an internet scale (<a href='https://decrypt.co/47178/vitalik-buterin-crypto-prediction-markets-outperformed-forecasts'>Vitalik's take'</a>).

Yet, they seem to overlook that, at the moment, prediction markets are - (drum roll) 

not fun. 

We can label it differently (UX, etc.), but the truth is they're just not as much fun right now. or perhaps it's better said - they're much less fun compared to other crypto activities.

For example:

- betting on hamster races on telegram - really fun 
- swapping meme coins on uniswap - really fun 
- flipping jpegs on blur - really fun
- betting on who will be the next president of Argentina - much less fun. maybe around 10%-15% fun level of the above activities.

In terms of contribution to the efficiency of society:

- betting on hamster races on telegram - zero contribution
- swapping meme coins on uniswap - zero contribution
- flipping jpegs on blur - zero contribution
- betting on the next president of Argentina - significant contribution to information efficiency

We need to bring the fun level of prediction markets closer to other activities. then, we'll reach the 'changing the world' zone - lots of fun and significant contribution.
