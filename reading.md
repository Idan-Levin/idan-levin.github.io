I find reading extremely important for broadening your mind and personal development. Here are my favorite 'classics' books across various categories:

### Science

The Beggining of Infinity 



### Economics/ Politics 

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denationalization_of_Money'>The Denationalization of Money</a> - This is probably one of the books that has influenced my economic thinking the most. In 1976, Hayek proposed something that is still considered highly radical today - the idea that governments should not control money. This simple concept encompasses many ideas prevalent in the crypto industry today, such as the fear of centralizing forces in the era of the internet and AI, the ability to censor individuals outside the system, the power of governments to coerce their populations, and the impact of inflation as a form of taxation.

This book serves as a practical guide on how we can achieve a system of non-governmental money, even in a pre-commercial internet era. Masterpiece. 

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Use_of_Knowledge_in_Society#:~:text=%22The%20Use%20of%20Knowledge%20in,of%20The%20American%20Economic%20Review.&text=Written%20(along%20with%20The%20Meaning,to%20fellow%20economist%20Oskar%20R.'>The Use of Knowledge in Society</a> - This is not actually a book but rather a profound paper by Hayek discussing how free markets and price systems serve as knowledge-transmitting systems. I believe that only a few modern economists truly grasp these concepts, which lay the groundwork for understanding why free price systems foster prosperity and why it is illogical for central banks to determine interest rates and the market value of money. Similar to everything Hayek wrote, you may need to read this multiple times, but it is completely worthwhile. 

The Prince - 

### Philloshopy 

<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469'>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a>  - This is a classic book from 1974 by Robert M. Pirsig. It is a fictional autobiography of Pirsig, describing his journeys on a motorcycle with his son in the US (with some flashbacks to a side story).

The book explores the concept of 'Quality.' It delves into what quality is and how it is defined, and whether we can accurately describe it. It uses the maintenance of the motorcycle as a metaphor and showcases different approaches to quality. The conclusion I drew from it was that quality is a middle ground between the 'romantic' approach (subjective) and the 'classical' approach (objective). The best outcomes in life come from the combination of rational thinking and emotions.

This is not an easy book to read. I read it while traveling in Mexico, and it took me about two months to finish. However, it greatly influenced the way I approach tasks and how I perceive doing things 'right'. 


### Novel / Fiction 

Catch-22

The Music of Chance

Shantaram 

Dune
