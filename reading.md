### Economics/ Politics 

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denationalization_of_Money'>The Sovereign Individual</a> - If you need to read one book that can best describe the future we will encounter in our lifetime, this is it. "The Sovereign Individual" explores the relationship between technological innovation and megapolitical structures, such as nation-states or the church before the 18th century. Many of the theories presented in this book were new to me, particularly regarding how humans organize themselves in large groups and the impact of what they call "the retuen on violence" and technological advancements.

The book provides compelling examples of this shifs, such as the invention of the printing press and gunpowder transformed megapolitical structures and gave rise to nation-states.

I find the notion that the combination of the transistor and the internet will fundamentally alter megapolitical structures highly likely. This suggests that during our lifetime, we are likely to witness a significant shift in the way humans collaborate within large groups.

“Violence is the ultimate boundary force on behavior; this, if you can understand how the logic of violence will change, you can usefully predict where people will be dropping or picking up the equivalent of one-hundred-dollar bills in the future.”

“In almost every competitive area, including most of the world’s multitrillion-dollar investment activity, the migration of transactions into cyberspace will be driven by an almost hydraulic pressure—the impetus to avoid predatory taxation, including the tax that inflation places upon everyone who holds his wealth in a national currency.”


<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denationalization_of_Money'>The Denationalization of Money</a> - This is probably one of the books that has influenced my economic thinking the most. In 1976, Hayek proposed something that is still considered highly radical today - the idea that governments should not control money. This simple concept encompasses many ideas prevalent in the crypto industry today, such as the fear of centralizing forces in the era of the internet and AI, the ability to censor individuals outside the system, the power of governments to coerce their populations, and the impact of inflation as a form of taxation.

This book serves as a practical guide on how we can achieve a system of non-governmental money, even in a pre-commercial internet era. Masterpiece. 

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Use_of_Knowledge_in_Society#:~:text=%22The%20Use%20of%20Knowledge%20in,of%20The%20American%20Economic%20Review.&text=Written%20(along%20with%20The%20Meaning,to%20fellow%20economist%20Oskar%20R.'>The Use of Knowledge in Society</a> - This is not actually a book but rather a profound paper by Hayek discussing how free markets and price systems serve as knowledge-transmitting systems. I believe that only a few modern economists truly grasp these concepts, which lay the groundwork for understanding why free price systems foster prosperity and why it is illogical for central banks to determine interest rates and the market value of money. Similar to everything Hayek wrote, you may need to read this multiple times, but it is completely worthwhile. 

<a href='https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/principles-for-navigating-big-debt-crises-by-ray-dalio.pdf'>Big Debt Crises</a> - Ray Dalio takes you on a bottom-up journey, illustrating how macro cycles unfold and demonstrating the patterns of historical debt cycles in a rigorous and methodological way.

“During the Great Depression there were six big rallies in the stock market (of between 16 percent and 48 percent) in a bear market that declined a total of 89 percent. All of those rallies were triggered by government actions that were intended to reduce the fundamental imbalance.”



<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince'>The Prince</a> - This is a dark book written during the 16th century to serve as a guide for rulers. Despite its dark nature, it provides an excellent framework for strategic thinking.

### Philloshopy 
 
<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Motorcycle-Maintenance-Inquiry/dp/0060589469'>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a>  - This is a classic book from 1974 by Robert M. Pirsig. It is a fictional autobiography of Pirsig, describing his journeys on a motorcycle with his son in the US (with some flashbacks to a side story).

The book explores the concept of 'Quality.' It delves into what quality is and how it is defined, and whether we can accurately describe it. It uses the maintenance of the motorcycle as a metaphor and showcases different approaches to quality. The conclusion I drew from it was that quality is a middle ground between the 'romantic' approach (subjective) and the 'classical' approach (objective). The best outcomes in life come from the combination of rational thinking and emotions.

This is not an easy book to read. I read it while traveling in Mexico, and it took me about two months to finish. However, it greatly influenced the way I approach tasks and how I perceive doing things 'right'. 


### Novel / Fiction 

 <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Catch-22-50th-Anniversary-Joseph-Heller/dp/1451626657'>Catch-22</a> - Catch 22 has so many quoates that I admire. It effectively portrays the absurdity of war and highlights the illogical situations individuals face when entangled in a larger system.

“He was going to live forever, or die in the attempt."

“Insanity is contagious.”

It raises questions about the extent to which individuals can shape their own destiny and the role that luck and chance play in determining outcomes.

 “Once a man begins to recognize himself in another, he can no longer look on that person as a stranger.”




 <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Dune-Frank-Herbert-audiobook/dp/B000R34YKC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=21E9UAMBBRUCE&keywords=dune+book&qid=1687772293&s=books&sprefix=dune+boo%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C247&sr=1-1'>Dune</a> - The Dune universe explores many fascinating aspects of human existence, including power struggles and politics, the relationship between humans and the environment, colonization and imperialism, as well as religion and community.  

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

### Science

<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359'>The Beggining of Infinity</a> - confession - I never finished reading this book. I'm constantly reading snippets of it and trying to process its content more and more. There is so much wisdom within its pages that you can't read a few pages without encountering truly beautiful thoughts that you want to think of repeatedly. The philosophy of science, the creation of knowledge, the uniqueness of humans, and the universe - all of these topics provoke fascinating ideas. What I appreciate most about The Beginning of Infinity is its optimistic outlook

“Without error-correction all information processing, and hence all knowledge-creation, is necessarily bounded. Error-correction is the beginning of infinity.”
