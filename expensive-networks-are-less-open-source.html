  <h1> expensive networks are less open source</h1>

  <p>Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, famously said, “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.” This quote highlights a key principle of open-source software: the more people who scrutinize a piece of code, the quicker and more effectively bugs and issues are identified and resolved. This concept underpins the open-source movement, which advocates for open access to source code and collaborative development as a path to more reliable and higher-quality software, in contrast to traditional closed-source methods.</p>

<p>In the blockchain world, a related concept involves the cost of running a full node. A full node typically means downloading the historical state, verifying it up to the current chain tip, and participating in real-time block reception and validation (not necessarily proposing blocks for network consensus). The cost of running a full node varies across different crypto networks, ranging from a few hundred dollars to millions.</p>

<p>The expense isn’t just about hardware and maintenance; it’s also about the complexity of the node software. I believe that the cost of running a full node is generally indicative of a network’s openness or, more specifically, the applicability of Linus’s rule. Low-cost nodes, which are more numerous and accessible, invite diverse participation. In contrast, networks with prohibitively expensive nodes often see participation limited to businesses, while affordable nodes attract hobbyists.</p>

<p>Hobbyists are crucial. They tend to be more neutral and openly critical. When the cost to run a node is low, a network is more likely to face scrutiny and attract a broader range of observers. Conversely, in networks where node operation is costly, only businesses with different incentives and motivations tend to participate.</p>

<p>This situation has two primary effects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bugs in network architecture take longer to be discovered.</li>
  <li>The network may accumulate unaddressed risks over time.</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter point relates to a lack of incentive for whistleblowing; the former, to the simple law of large numbers.</p>

<p>Consequently, I’m more cautious about networks with high participation costs. They require more time to prove their robustness, and they carry a higher risk of accumulating systemic issues. While high-cost networks can still function, when it comes to the robustness stemming from open-source development, I tend to trust architectures derived from networks with lower participation costs.</p>
